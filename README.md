# Project-Two

Welcome to HAVIT:

* 
Using rails (= 4.2.4) on a ruby platform.
The site is an app for giving and getting stuff for free in your local area. 

You need to become a member in order to give or get but you can look at the listings without signing up. 

* 
The landing page uses a javascipt & canvas animation from codrops (/tympanus.net). It's an animation loop using requestAnimationFrame and features triangles modified to create different effects. Find it here: http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/09/23/animated-background-headers/

* 
Using PostsgreSQL the database uses 4 models to enable users to trade their stuff.

* 
I relied on Bootstrap for styling and customised the site using images and google fonts.
 
*
I implemented a reviews and rating system which has yet to be developed fully. The idea is that members with higher ratings will be given preference for getting items. 
Buttons and design features will also be upgraded after the initial launch. 
Location gems will be used to help members locate items. 

*
The site is deployed on Heroku.
